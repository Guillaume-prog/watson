# Watson
***

Watson is a discord bot that inspires itself form the [uni-notes](https://github.com/Guillaume-prog/uni-notes) and [uniclic](https://github.com/Guillaume-prog/Uniclic) projects. It aims to assist students with tools and reminders.

## Features

### Average calculator

A simple feature that automatically fetches a students marks and calculates their average based on said marks.

*To avoid overloading the university's server's, this action can only be performed once a day.*

### Timetable reminders (in development)

Students subscribed to this service (using roles) will be notified for their next lesson and will have a link for the teachers zoom class.
